I hope to develop this in the future so that you can learn how to make cakes and bakery products.
I was unable to develop the event visualization section here, so I am waiting for it to be developed and completed.

You can start this project by typing (npm start) in the terminal.
Then both the frontend and backend will start at the same time.
